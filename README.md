# res
Res can either be understanded as ([re]stricted [s]ource) or [r]estrictions [e]asily [s]implified. This language is designed to make restricted source challenges easy or even trivial.

Of course it sucks on this job, like it can not compete with more powerful languages on more general competitions.
