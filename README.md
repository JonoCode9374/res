# res - How easy (or trivial) can a restricted-source challenge get?
Res can either be understanded as ([re]stricted [s]ource) or [r]estrictions [e]asily [s]implified. This language is designed to make restricted source challenges easy or even trivial. (Alternative name for challenges that do not relate to the language name length: Resource)

Read the source code to find out what each instruction does! (However, I will add an instruction reference and a tutorial(if I have time for it) as soon as possible.)
